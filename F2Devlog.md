### How We Satisfied the Software Requirements

We continued to use Three.js and well as Cannon-es.js for our 3d rendering and physics simulation respectively.

We then tackled the idea of different scenes/rooms, so there are now two rooms on either side of the man play area that the player can visit.
and inside each of these rooms are items that can be clicked on and interacted with outside of physics stuff. 

The must first solve our physics based puzzle to actually reach the second room, (spoliers, you just have move a cube over to it lol), but be careful once you get to the other side...

Each of these rooms have another cube that he player may interact with clickong on. This is the second "puzzle" but its not physics based really. 
This puzzle is where we impliment the inventory. The player may interact with the key object to puck up the key into their inventory, and once they obtain it, they may unlock the chest.

The game reaches its one conculsive ending once the chest is unlocked!

### Reflection

Our plan changed drastically from our initial goal of a satirical AI dating sim, as when we made the plan, we didn't have access to the requirements and limitations. So our new goal was to just go with the flow. So we moved onto to just implementing the physics and rendering and seeing where things go from there. We mostly stuck with what roles we were assigned, only switching engines and tools as opposed to jobs. Overall not too bad, and hopefully we can get averything else done just as seamlessly.
