# EmBrace Me

## DevLog Entry 1 - 11/14/2025

### Meet the Team

Tools Lead: Tate Maguire

Engine Lead: Jared Nussbaum

Design Lead: Torrey Spear

Testing Lead: Tate Maguire

Writing Lead: Jared Nussbaum

### Tools and Materials

Engine: Baseline javascript with Three.js and Oimo.js plugins for 3d rendering and physics.

Language: JS - A bad game programming language

Tools: Procreate for artwork, as that is what our artists are most comfortable with.

AI: Absolutely none! We are game developers, and as such, we will not be using AI tools on this project as they take away a lot of the learning and creativity of the game-making process.

### Outlook

Our team is hoping to implement a touching story in which the player becomes romantically involved with the Brace AI. Most teams will be focusing on making gameplay mechanics, but we want to deliver a story experience that stays with players after playing. We see that it may be difficult to include a physics puzzle in our game, but we will perservere and figure it out. We are hoping to learn how to make a gameplay sequence that conveys emotion that ties into the game itself.
